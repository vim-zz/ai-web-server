# AI Web Server

A simple web server with a centered text input interface built using Flask.

## How It Works

This project is like a smart registration form that uses AI to chat with users. Here are the main parts:

1. **Web Interface** (`templates/index.html`, `static/styles.css`, `static/script.js`)
   - Shows a chat window where you can type messages
   - Displays the collected information in real-time
   - Uses basic HTML, CSS for looks, and JavaScript to handle user input

2. **Web Server** (`app.py`)
   - Built with Flask (a simple Python web framework)
   - Receives messages from the chat
   - Sends responses back to the browser

3. **Chat Handler** (`chat_handler.py`)
   - ðŸ¤– The brain of the application
   - âœ¨ Talks to OpenAI's API (like having a smart robot helper)
   - Keeps track of what information we've collected
   - Makes sure we get all the required details (name, username, password, workplace)

The cool part is how these pieces work together:
1. You type a message
2. JavaScript sends it to the Flask server
3. The Chat Handler asks OpenAI what to say next
4. The response comes back to your screen

Think of it like a relay race where each part passes the information to the next!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- OpenAI API key

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-web-server
```

2. Install uv (if not already installed)
```bash
pip install uv
```

3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
uv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
# MacOS
source .venv\scripts\activate

# Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install dependencies
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

6. Set up your OpenAI API key:

   a. Get your API key:
   - Go to [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/signup)
   - Sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Click "Create new secret key"
   - Copy your API key (make sure to save it as it won't be shown again)

   b. Add your API key to the `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Note: Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key

7. Run the server
```bash
uv run -m ai_web_server.app
```

## Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Important Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API key secret and secure
- The free tier of OpenAI's API has rate limits and usage limits
- Monitor your API usage on OpenAI's dashboard to avoid unexpected charges

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter "Authentication Error" or similar:
1. Double-check your API key in the `.env` file
2. Ensure the `.env` file is in the correct location (project root)
3. Make sure you activated the virtual environment
4. Try restarting the server
