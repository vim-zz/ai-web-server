# AI Web Server

A simple web server with a centered text input interface built using Flask.

## How It Works

This project is like a smart registration form that uses AI to chat with users. Here are the main parts:

1. **Web Interface** (`templates/index.html`, `static/styles.css`, `static/script.js`)
   - Shows a chat window where you can type messages
   - Displays the collected information in real-time
   - Uses basic HTML, CSS for looks, and JavaScript to handle user input

2. **Web Server** (`app.py`)
   - Built with Flask (a simple Python web framework)
   - Receives messages from the chat
   - Sends responses back to the browser

3. **Chat Handler** (`chat_handler.py`)
   - ðŸ¤– The brain of the application
   - âœ¨ Talks to OpenAI's API (like having a smart robot helper)
   - Keeps track of what information we've collected
   - Makes sure we get all the required details (name, username, password, workplace)

The cool part is how these pieces work together:
1. You type a message
2. JavaScript sends it to the Flask server
3. The Chat Handler asks OpenAI what to say next
4. The response comes back to your screen

Think of it like a relay race where each part passes the information to the next!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Groq API key

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or Download the repository

Download as Zip from GitHub [ai-web-server](https://github.com/vim-zz/ai-web-server) or clone:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai-web-server
```

2. Install uv (if not already installed)
For MacOS:
```bash
pip install uv
```

For Windows:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

3. Create a virtual environment
```bash
uv venv
```

4. Activate the virtual environment
For MacOS:
```bash
source .venv\scripts\activate
```

For Windows:
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

You might encounter an error about running scripts being disabled. If so, run the following command:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

# try activating the virtual environment again:
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Install dependencies
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

6. Set up your Groq API key:

   a. Get your API key:
   - Go to [Groq's website](https://console.groq.com/login)
   - Sign up for an account if you don't have one
   - Navigate to [API Keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
   - Click "Create API key"
   - Copy your API key (make sure to save it as it won't be shown again)

   b. Add your API key to the `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Note: Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key

7. Run the server
```bash
uv run -m ai_web_server.app
```

## Accessing the Application

Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Important Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API key secret and secure
- The free tier API has rate limits and usage limits
